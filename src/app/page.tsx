  Your task is to create a dynamic card component for each server in the list.
  - The card should display the server's name, game, players, status, version etc, bonus points for displaying any extra data from the json response.
  - please use tailwind to style your components, you can use the existing styles in this file as a reference.
  - You can also use any other libraries you like to help you build the UI.
  
  for extra info please read the README.md file in the root of the project.
